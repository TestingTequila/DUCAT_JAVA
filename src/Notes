1. Testing shows presence of Bugs: We should write as many test cases as possible.
2. Exhaustive Testing is Impossible: WE should not test a particular test cases for all the possible test data available.
  -Techniques to pick the right data from large set of test data available
      -> Equivalence Partitioning
      -> Boundary Value Analysis
3. Early Testing Principal: Your testing starts as soon as requirement is given to you by the client


Test Design: Identifying the attributes against which the test cases are to be written

SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle

- Requirement Analysis Phase => SRS
   i) Requirement given is complete or not
   ii)Requirement given is correct or not

- Feasibility Study Phase
- Design Phase
- Coding/Development Phase
- TESTING PHASE
- Deployment Phase
- Maintenance Phase

4. Defect Clustering Principal/Pareto Principal: Defects are not evenly distributed rather than are clustered around some specific module
                                               : 80% of defects are identified across 20% module
