DUCAT - S2
1. Testing shows presence of Bugs: We should write as many test cases as possible.
2. Exhaustive Testing is Impossible: WE should not test a particular test cases for all the possible test data available.
  -Techniques to pick the right data from large set of test data available
      -> Equivalence Partitioning
      -> Boundary Value Analysis
3. Early Testing Principal: Your testing starts as soon as requirement is given to you by the client


Test Design: Identifying the attributes against which the test cases are to be written

SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle

- Requirement Analysis Phase => SRS
   i) Requirement given is complete or not
   ii)Requirement given is correct or not

- Feasibility Study Phase
- Design Phase
- Coding/Development Phase
- TESTING PHASE
- Deployment Phase
- Maintenance Phase

4. Defect Clustering Principal/Pareto Principal: Defects are not evenly distributed rather than are clustered around some specific module
                                               : 80% of defects are identified across 20% module

Variables:

Syntax:
  -datatype variableName = value;

  -datatype variableName;
   variableName = value;


Make Tea:
 -sugar
 -Tea Leaves
 -Milk Powder

Statements:
 //To make decisions
   -if Else Statement
    if(condition)
    {
        This will be executed only when condition is true;
    }
    else
    {
       This will be executed only when condition is false;
    }
   -If-else if statement
   if(condition1)
   {
       this logic will execute only if condition1 is true;
   }
   else if(condition2)
   {
   this logic will execute only if condition2 is true;
   }

      else if(condition3)
      {
      this logic will execute only if condition3 is true;
      }
      else if(conditionN)
      {
       this logic will execute only if conditionN is true;
      }
      else
      {
        this logic will execute when all of the above conditions is false;
      }
   -switch statement
     switch(variable)
     {
        case variable:
        logic;
        break;

                case variable:
                logic;
                break;

                        case variable:
                        logic;
                        break;
     }

=======Loops============================
repeating task.....we will use loops...
0- do while loop: This loop will always execute at-least once even if condition is false
1- while loop
    dataType variable;
    while(ConditionOverVariable)
    {
        logic;
        I/D;
    }
2- for loop

    for(dataType variable;ConditionOverVariable;I/D)
    {
        logic;
    }

3- advanced for loop

===================Arrays Concepts===================================
dataType[] arrayName = {value1,value2,value3, value4......};
